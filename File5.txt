This is my new file in branch created from local Feature2Branch.
Now this file will be pushed to repo.

How are we able to create a branch in local?
We need a source branch.

When Feature2Branch is created, we were in feature1branch.

So Feature2branch has all the info of feature1,


So whichever branch you want to branch into (master or feature 1 or feature x) first checkto that out and then create a branch.


New feature5 branch to show merge from local
